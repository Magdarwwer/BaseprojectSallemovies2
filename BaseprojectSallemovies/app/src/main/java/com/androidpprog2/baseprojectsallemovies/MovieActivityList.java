//To display a list of all the crimes, we should create a new Activity, called CrimeListActivity. This new Activity will contain
//a fragment called CrimeListFragment.

//To create our CrimeListActivity, we will need the same exact code we used to create our CrimeActivity. We will only
//need to add our fragment type we will create an instance for. Instead of copying every time the code for every activity,
//we will create and abstract activity class in which weâ€™ll only need to specific the fragment to load.

//Activity to display list of all movies! it will contain MovieListFragment
